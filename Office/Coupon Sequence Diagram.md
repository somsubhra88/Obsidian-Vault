Before answering those questions, I would like to explain the process. When a user comes to our platform, we will first identify the customer, extracting the easy id, and this identification process will be done from the coupon platform itself. The coupon platform will feed this information to RL Engine Prediction API. RL Engine will do three things asynchronously - first, fetching the user features from CDNA; second, extracting the coupon attributes from GSP and finally, CTR & CVR information from RAT. Once we have all three components of contexts, RL Engine will form all the possible contexts. RL Engine will next pull the Cached Model from the Redis Cluster and feed the recently developed contexts. The Cached Model throws the probability of each context, which means the likelihood of clicking each coupon. RL Engine will order the coupons based on the probability and then sends them back to the coupon platform. Then coupon platform will display the coupons in that order.

We are sceptical about the system's throughput and latency, except involving RAT; we can do the rest in the allowable duration. To get the actual throughput, we need to do a PoC.
