### I think the uplift mode is to access what action will improve the probability that users will purchase right?

#### Are users already happy and going to purchase anyway, so we should waste advertising dollars?

Will our ads annoy users and therefore negatively impact their probability to purchase?

Are they persuadable and therefore the right target to advertise? 

Or they have already made up their mind not to purchase. 

How do we learn what is the best action to take that optimizes towards the final purchase not the local optimize action?  

How does the contextual bandit or an efficient algorithm to balance explore and exploit fit here? Is it for learning the best action at each step?
