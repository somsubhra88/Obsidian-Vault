The objective is to determine the most cost-effective allocation of resources to fulfil orders while adhering to specific constraints, such as resource availability, demand requirements, and operational rules. It uses mathematical modelling to minimize the total costs associated with resource assignments across different orders, ensuring that each order is met with the optimal combination of resources and options. This optimization process aims to find a balance between meeting demands precisely and efficiently using resources and minimizing the overall operational costs while respecting logistical limitations and business rules.
