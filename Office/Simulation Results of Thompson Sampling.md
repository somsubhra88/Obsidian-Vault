Earlier Click Through Rate(CTR) was the metric we optimized using Bandit Algorithm and predominantly we're using [[Thompson Beta Sampling]]. This we wanted to optimize Conversion Rate(CVR), while we're trying to optimize this we faced several challenges - 
- **Delayed Feedback** - Conversion feedback is delayed and so an immediate reward was not available, hence updation of the Bandit was not possible even after taking an action
- **Anonymous Feedback** - It is quite possible that before a conversion a customer has experience several different banner and at the time of the conversion it is really
