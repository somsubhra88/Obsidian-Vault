## Questions on the presentation

### What is GSP? How to access GSP?
### How are coupons being analysed?
### What is coupon media?
### What do we mean by "Extraction of Coupons"?
### Do we have any master database where all the available coupons exist?
### If I understood correctly, it's a matching problem between the user and the coupons based on several parameters and factors. Is that a correct assumption?
