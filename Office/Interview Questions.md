# Coding Questions
1. You are given two positive integers $a$ and $b$. In one move you can increase $a$ by 1 (replace $a$ with $a+1$). Your task is to find the minimum number of moves you need to do in order to make $a$ divisible by $b$. It is possible, that you have to make 0 moves, as $a$ is already divisible by $b$.
