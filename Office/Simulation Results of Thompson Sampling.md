# Background
Earlier Click Through Rate(CTR) was the metric we optimized using Bandit Algorithm and predominantly we're using [[Thompson Beta Sampling]]. This we wanted to optimize Conversion Rate(CVR), while we're trying to optimize this we faced several challenges - 
- **Delayed Feedback** - Conversion feedback is delayed and so an immediate reward was not available, hence updation of the Bandit was not possible even after taking an action
- **Anonymous Feedback** - It is quite possible that before a conversion a customer has experience several different banner and at the time of the conversion it is really difficult to attribute this conversion to all the banner he has seen previously, moreover it will be entirely illogical to give the entire credit to the last seen banner
